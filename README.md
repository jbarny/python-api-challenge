Descriptions of each WeatherPy plot can be found in a commented cell below each plot. Descriptions of each pair of linear regression plots can be found in a commented cell below the second plot of each set. A list of three observable trends can be found in a commented cell at the bottom of the WeatherPy Jupyter Notebook file. 

Before executing code, open the api_keys.py file and update with your own OWM and Google Maps API keys as below:

# OpenWeatherMap API Key
weather_api_key = "YOUR API KEY"

# Google API Key
g_key = "YOUR API KEY"
